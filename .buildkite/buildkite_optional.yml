# Build steps in this file do not block PR merges; they are "optional". Typically you
# will want to add steps to `buildkite_required.yml` instead.
#
# FOR LARGE REPOS, limit the contents to triggering other pipelines that do the
# actual work, so that this stays a clear overview of build fan-out using an
# instance of the heap/monorepo-diff plugin as needed.
#
# FOR SMALL REPOS, this file can directly contain build-steps.
