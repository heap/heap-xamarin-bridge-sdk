# Build steps in this file DO block PR merges; they are "required". This is where
# you will want to put most of your build steps to protect your main branch and
# keep it green.
#
# FOR LARGE REPOS, limit the contents to triggering other pipelines that do the
# actual work, so that this stays a clear overview of build fan-out using an
# instance of the heap/monorepo-diff plugin as needed.
#
# FOR SMALL REPOS, this file can directly contain build-steps.
